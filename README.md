# tweaking-a-stackoverflow-example-in-go
Just a small tweak to a stackoverflow [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38777961/converting-string-input-to-float64-using-parsefloat-in-golang) about GO parse float functionality demoed as a calculator of pounds into grams and feet to meters conversion

# Here is how the app works:
1) you can clone this repo: git clone https://github.com/whatafunc/tweaking-a-stackoverflow-example-in-go.git
2) cd to the cloned repo && issue cmd: go run test.go 
3) enjoy the calculation output:
hello, this calc converts 15 pounds into grams & 21 feet to meters for you
15
15 lbs converted to grams gives 6803.88 gr
21
21 feet converted to meters give you 6.4008 meters
